# Self-Hosted Remote Daemon

This guide covers running Pane on your own workstation, Mac mini, Linux box, or VM and connecting to it from the local Pane desktop app or the Remote Pane browser app.

The intended flow is:

1. Run one setup command on the remote machine.
2. Copy the generated `pane-remote://...` connection code.
3. Paste it into desktop Pane under `Settings > Remote Pane`, or open `https://runpane.com/app/` and paste it there.

Pane saves the profile and attempts to connect immediately. Local desktop mode is unchanged until a remote profile is imported and activated.

## Guided quick start

On the host machine, run `npx --yes runpane@latest` in an interactive terminal.
Choose **Set up a remote host**, enter a name (or press Enter),
and follow the Tailscale installation/login prompts. The wizard picks an available
port and prints a connection code. Sign your other device into the same Tailscale
network, then paste the code into Pane or [runpane.com/app](https://runpane.com/app/).

SSH and manual URL setups remain available through the explicit commands below.
The no-argument and `setup` commands print help in non-interactive shells; they
do not start a login prompt.

## Creating a code in desktop Settings

Desktop setup uses an installed, signed-in Tailscale client. If Tailscale is
missing, Pane shows installation instructions; use the setup terminal to install
it. Tailscale discovery, Serve configuration and requested daemon service setup
run asynchronously so the desktop stays responsive while they finish.

## One-Command Setup

To skip the wizard menu, run interactive remote setup directly:

```bash
npx --yes runpane@latest install daemon --interactive-tailscale-setup --auto-listen-port --label "VM"
pnpm dlx runpane@latest install daemon --interactive-tailscale-setup --auto-listen-port --label "VM"
pipx run runpane install daemon --interactive-tailscale-setup --auto-listen-port --label "VM"
uvx runpane@latest install daemon --interactive-tailscale-setup --auto-listen-port --label "VM"
```

SSH tunnel mode:

```bash
npx --yes runpane@latest install daemon --label "VM" --prefer-tunnel ssh
```

Persistent installs are also supported:

```bash
npm i -g runpane
runpane install daemon --interactive-tailscale-setup --auto-listen-port --label "VM"

python -m pip install runpane
runpane install daemon --interactive-tailscale-setup --auto-listen-port --label "VM"
```

From a source checkout:

```bash
pnpm remote:setup -- --label "VM"
```

SSH tunnel mode:

```bash
pnpm remote:setup -- --label "VM" --prefer-tunnel ssh
```

For validation against a separate data directory:

```bash
PANE_DIR=/tmp/pane-remote-vm pnpm remote:setup -- --label "VM" --prefer-tunnel ssh --print-only
```

Packaged Pane builds can run the same setup path without opening a window:

```bash
pane --remote-setup --label "VM"
```

On displayless Linux hosts, prefer `runpane install daemon`; the npm and PyPI
wrappers pass Electron's required headless flags automatically. For a direct
packaged launch, pass them explicitly:

```bash
pane --ozone-platform=headless --disable-gpu --remote-setup --label "VM"
```

These must be command-line arguments: Electron picks its Ozone platform before
the app starts, so the environment variable `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT` no
longer works (removed in Electron 38, ignored from 39 on).

The wrappers are lightweight installers and configurators. They currently
download the packaged Pane runtime because the daemon is not distributed as a
separate binary. AppImage installs therefore require FUSE; on Debian-based
hosts, `--format deb` avoids the AppImage/FUSE requirement.

If Pane is already installed on the host, this is the most direct command:

```bash
pane --remote-setup --label "VM" --prefer-tunnel tailscale
```

The setup command:

- detects Linux, macOS, or Windows host behavior
- writes remote daemon config into one `PANE_DIR` (default `~/.pane_remote`)
- enables the loopback listener on `127.0.0.1:42137`
- creates a paired client record with a hashed token on the host
- emits the raw token only inside the one-time `pane-remote://...` import code
- attempts to install and start a user-level daemon service (on Linux, it also
  enables lingering so the service keeps running after you log out)
- prints the manual daemon command if service setup is unavailable
- detects Tailscale Serve where possible and otherwise prints an SSH local-forward command

Useful options:

```bash
pnpm remote:setup -- --help
pnpm remote:setup -- --channel nightly
pnpm remote:setup -- --pane-dir "$HOME/.pane_remote"
pnpm remote:setup -- --prefer-tunnel ssh
pnpm remote:setup -- --no-install-service
pnpm remote:setup -- --no-tailscale-serve
```

## Run Pane on a Cloud VM

Pane does not create or manage cloud machines. Create the VM yourself, then set
it up as a Remote Pane host:

1. Create an Ubuntu 24.04 VM with any provider. Size it for the agents and
   builds you plan to run. It only needs inbound SSH. The daemon listens on
   loopback, and you reach it through Tailscale or an SSH tunnel.
2. SSH in as a regular user with `sudo`, not as `root`.
3. Install what your agents need on the VM: `git`, Node.js 20 or newer (for
   `npx`), and the agent CLIs you use, such as Claude Code or Codex. Sign in
   to each CLI on the VM. Agents run there, not on your laptop.
4. Install Tailscale and join your tailnet:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up
   ```

5. Install Pane and create a connection code. `--format deb` installs the
   Debian package, so the host does not need FUSE:

   ```bash
   npx --yes runpane@latest install daemon --label "Cloud VM" --format deb
   ```

6. Check that the daemon keeps running after you log out. It runs as a systemd
   user service, and setup turns on lingering (through passwordless `sudo` if
   needed) so the service outlives your SSH session. If the setup output says
   it could not, enable lingering yourself:

   ```bash
   sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
   systemctl --user status pane-remote-daemon.service
   ```

7. Paste the printed `pane-remote://...` code into desktop Pane (see
   [Import Locally](#import-locally)) or into `https://runpane.com/app/`.

To start, stop, or delete the VM, use your provider's console or CLI. If
something fails, run `npx --yes runpane@latest doctor --json` on the VM and
check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Import Locally

On your local desktop machine:

1. Open Pane.
2. Go to `Settings > Remote Pane`.
3. Paste the full `pane-remote://...` code into `Import Remote Connection`.
4. Click `Import & Connect`.

If the tunnel is not reachable yet, Pane still saves the profile and shows the connection error. Start the printed SSH/Tailscale tunnel and click `Connect` on the saved profile.

## Use the Mobile / Browser App

The same connection code works in the Remote Pane PWA:

```text
https://runpane.com/app/
```

Use the PWA for phone or tablet access to terminal-backed remote sessions:

1. Set up the remote host with Tailscale or a trusted HTTPS tunnel.
2. Copy the full `pane-remote://...` code printed by setup.
3. Open `https://runpane.com/app/` on the client device.
4. Paste the code and connect.

For iPhone or iPad, open the URL in Safari, tap Share, then tap `Add to Home Screen`.
For Android, open the URL in Chrome, open the browser menu, then tap `Add to Home screen` or `Install app`.

SSH tunnel mode is mainly useful from desktop clients. For mobile browser access, prefer Tailscale or Manual HTTPS so the phone can reach the daemon URL directly.

### Remote PWA Implementation Notes

The Remote Pane PWA is a browser runtime. It does not have `window.electronAPI`, so client-side PWA preferences must use browser-safe storage such as `localStorage` or explicit daemon adapter calls. Do not reuse desktop renderer preference stores that persist through Electron IPC unless the call path is guarded for browser mode.

## Security Model

- The daemon listener only supports loopback hosts: `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or `localhost`.
- Direct public or LAN binding is intentionally rejected.
- Use SSH local forwarding, Tailscale Serve, or a trusted HTTPS reverse proxy that forwards to loopback.
- Treat the generated `pane-remote://...` code like a secret. It contains the bearer token needed by the local client.

Tailscale Serve example generated by setup:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:42137
```

SSH fallback generated by setup:

```bash
ssh -N -L 42137:127.0.0.1:42137 user@your-host
```

## Manual Advanced Flow

The old manual flow still works and is useful for debugging.

### 1. Choose the Host Data Directory

```bash
export PANE_DIR="$HOME/.pane_remote"
mkdir -p "$PANE_DIR"
```

Pane stores config and database files under that directory. The setup command, desktop app, and headless daemon must use the same `PANE_DIR`.

### 2. Configure the Remote Listener

Launch Pane on the host against that directory:

```bash
PANE_DIR="$HOME/.pane_remote" pnpm dev
```

In `Settings > Remote Pane`:

1. Enable `Enable remote daemon listener`.
2. Keep `Listen Host` on `127.0.0.1`.
3. Keep or change `Listen Port`, default `42137`.
4. Leave `Require pairing / saved bearer tokens` enabled.
5. Leave `Allow direct HTTP on loopback` enabled.
6. Save host settings.

### 3. Create a Paired Connection

From the same settings section on the host:

1. Enter a label such as `Office Mac mini`.
2. Enter the base URL the client will use after tunneling, for example `http://127.0.0.1:42137`.
3. Click `Create Paired Profile`.

Pane adds a host-side allowed client record, adds a matching local profile, and shows the generated bearer token once.

### 4. Start the Headless Daemon

```bash
PANE_DIR="$HOME/.pane_remote" pnpm daemon:headless
```

On success:

```text
[Pane daemon] Headless host ready on tcp:127.0.0.1:42137
```

### 5. Connect the Desktop Client

Use `Import Remote Connection` for a generated code, or use `Save Existing Remote Profile` with:

- label
- base URL
- bearer token

Then click `Connect` on the saved profile.

## Validation

Recommended checks after connecting:

1. Verify projects and sessions load in the client.
2. Open a terminal-backed session and confirm output streaming works.
3. Send terminal input and verify the remote runtime receives it.
4. Resize a terminal and confirm the remote terminal resizes.
5. Open a file and confirm read/write works.
6. Check git status and commit/diff flows.
7. Run an approve-mode command and confirm the permission dialog appears on the client.

## Troubleshooting

Start with machine-readable environment diagnostics:

```bash
runpane doctor --json
```

The `remoteSetup` section reports stable diagnostic codes and recovery commands
for missing AppImage/FUSE support, Electron sandbox restrictions, and missing
user service management. `runpane install daemon` automatically supplies the
Linux headless launch environment. Pane never disables the Electron sandbox
automatically; use `--no-sandbox` only when the host requires it and you accept
the security tradeoff.

### Remote setup exits because X11 or `$DISPLAY` is missing

Use `runpane install daemon`, or add `--ozone-platform=headless --disable-gpu`
to a direct packaged launch. This failure occurs before Tailscale setup and does
not mean the daemon requires a graphical session. If you previously relied on
`ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=headless`, switch to the flags: Electron removed
that variable in 38 and ignores it from 39 on.

### The headless daemon starts but remote connect fails

Check:

- the daemon uses the same `PANE_DIR` that setup wrote
- the tunnel/proxy forwards to the same loopback port as the host config
- the client profile base URL matches the client-side tunnel endpoint
- the `pane-remote://...` code was not truncated

### A remote action could not be confirmed

The browser client automatically retries a reviewed set of read-only requests after
transient network or server failures. It sends actions such as terminal input and
pane creation once: the host may finish an action even if the response is lost.
If Pane says the action may have completed, inspect the current panes or terminal
before submitting it again. Authentication failures stop immediately.

The browser normally uses native EventSource for output. Its fetch fallback and
the desktop transport share one SSE text parser, accepting LF, CRLF, and CR line
endings across chunks. Each transport decodes UTF-8 incrementally before parsing;
reconnecting discards the previous stream's incomplete event. Terminal output
responses are applied only to the terminal instance that requested them, so a
late response cannot clear or write to a terminal disposed during a tab switch.

### I changed host settings but nothing happened

The headless daemon watches config and starts or stops the remote transport based on saved host config. If behavior looks stale, restart the daemon once and verify the correct `PANE_DIR`.

### Why can’t I bind to `0.0.0.0` or a LAN IP?

That is intentionally blocked. The current security model is loopback plus a secure exposure layer.

### Why are some actions disabled in remote mode?

Some actions operate on the local desktop client machine rather than the remote workspace. Pane currently disables or keeps local-only behavior for:

- opening a local IDE from the client
- revealing files in the client OS file manager
- the native clipboard-image fallback path

### Which machine do repo paths refer to?

The remote host. In remote mode, Open project, New project and Clone run on the host's daemon, so every path you pick or type is a path on that host. The daemon lists the host's folders through `fs:browse-directories` (it opens at the host's home folder) and checks typed paths there:

- On a Linux or macOS host, a Windows path such as `C:\Users\me\repo` is rejected with "That's a path on this computer; <host> is a Linux host. Pick a folder on <host>."
- Open project needs an existing git repository on the host. It never creates a folder or runs `git init`; New project does both.
- Clone defaults to the host's home folder, and `~` in the destination means the host's home.

### Where does copied terminal text go?

To the clipboard of the machine you are sitting at. In remote mode, dragging to select text in a terminal copies it right away, with no Copy popover. Programs that copy with OSC 52, such as Claude Code, tmux, and vim, also copy to your machine. Programs in the terminal cannot read your clipboard through OSC 52.

## Current Limitations

- No hosted relay, NAT traversal, or account-based multi-tenant auth
- No direct non-loopback listener support
- No full live remote end-to-end CI harness yet
# Mobile push notifications

The native companion may register an APNs/FCM token through its existing paired bearer token. Registrations are scoped to that paired client and revalidated before every send. The daemon sends generic attention alerts for `blocked` and settled `working → idle` transitions; controls can disable either category per device. See [Native mobile](NATIVE_MOBILE.md) for the operator-only credentials and signing setup.
