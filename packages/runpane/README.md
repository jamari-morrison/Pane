# runpane

Install or configure Pane from npm.

The package does not include the Pane desktop runtime. It downloads the correct
Pane release artifact only when you run `runpane install` or `runpane update`.

## Quick Start

Run the guided setup (Node 20 or newer):

```bash
npx --yes runpane@latest
```

Persistent install:

```bash
npm i -g runpane
runpane setup
```

Use the arrow keys and Enter to choose an action; Esc or Ctrl+C cancels.

The wizard can install Pane on this machine, configure this machine as a remote
host, update Pane, or run diagnostics. For remote access, choose **Set up a remote
host**, accept or enter a name, and follow the Tailscale login
prompts. Copy the connection code into Pane on your other device or
[runpane.com/app](https://runpane.com/app/). Sign that device into the same
Tailscale network first. No tunnel flags are needed in the wizard.

## MCP Server

`runpane mcp` runs a stdio MCP server whose tools mirror the `runpane`
commands, generated from the CLI contract. The Pane desktop app registers it
with Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor automatically. To register it yourself:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user pane -- npx --yes runpane@latest mcp
codex mcp add pane -- npx --yes runpane@latest mcp
```

See [docs/PANE_MCP.md](https://github.com/greenfield-inc/Pane/blob/main/docs/PANE_MCP.md).

## Developing This Repository

When debugging RunPane from a Pane repository checkout, prefer the built local
wrapper over `npx --yes runpane@latest` so diagnostics exercise local changes:

```bash
PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH node packages/runpane/dist/cli.js doctor --json
```

`doctor` remains the first diagnostic command before local-control actions. On
macOS it reads installed app bundle metadata and must not launch
`Pane.app/Contents/MacOS/Pane --version`.

## Advanced

### Explicit Commands

```bash
npx --yes runpane@latest setup
npx --yes runpane@latest install client
npx --yes runpane@latest install daemon --label "My Server"
npx --yes runpane@latest update
npx --yes runpane@latest doctor
```

`runpane install daemon` installs Pane and then invokes the installed executable
with `--remote-setup`, preserving the `pane-remote://...` connection-code output.

### Package Managers

One-shot execution:

```bash
pnpm dlx runpane@latest
yarn dlx runpane@latest
bunx runpane@latest
```

Persistent install:

```bash
npm i -g runpane
runpane setup

pnpm add -g runpane
runpane setup
```

### Commands

```bash
runpane
runpane setup
runpane install
runpane install client
runpane install daemon
runpane update
runpane version
runpane doctor
runpane --help
```

### Cloud Sandboxes (experimental)

`runpane cloud` creates a [boat.dev](https://boat.dev) sandbox with Pane installed, joins it to your tailnet,
pairs it and saves it as a remote host in desktop Pane. Desktop Pane's **Add cloud sandbox** uses the same code.

```bash
runpane cloud setup --boat-key-file - --tailscale-client-id <id> --tailscale-secret-file <path>
runpane cloud new --label "Cloud sandbox" --yes
runpane cloud list
runpane cloud status <host>
runpane cloud stop <host> --yes
runpane cloud start <host>
runpane cloud update <host> --pane-deb-url <https url> --pane-deb-sha256 <hex> --yes
runpane cloud remove <host> --yes
```

Keys are read from files or stdin and stay in `~/.config/runpane-cloud` (0600). Prerequisites and details:
[Cloud sandbox](https://github.com/greenfield-inc/Pane/blob/main/docs/SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_DAEMON.md#cloud-sandbox-experimental).

### Common Options

```bash
--version <latest|vX.Y.Z>
--format <auto|appimage|deb|dmg|zip|exe>
--download-dir <path>
--pane-path <path>
--dry-run
--verbose
```

Daemon setup also forwards Pane remote-host options:

```bash
--label <name>
--prefer-tunnel <tailscale|ssh|manual|auto>
--print-only
```

### Watching the Workspace

`runpane watch` waits for workspace transitions from the Pane daemon without
polling. Under `--follow` it prints one line per event: `READY` (a turn ended),
`BLOCKED` (the agent is waiting on a human), `IDLE`, `STUCK` (real unsubmitted
composer text; an agent prompt suggestion never counts), `NEW`, `GONE`, `EXIT`,
plus `HEARTBEAT` every 60 seconds as proof of life.

```bash
runpane watch --self-test
runpane watch --follow
```

The defaults are responsive: no settle, no batching, all event kinds, `IDLE`
every 10 minutes. Panes and shell users see every event immediately.

A consumer that pays for every line (an orchestrator that re-reads its whole
context per wake-up) opts into cadence shaping instead. This is the recommended
orchestrator invocation, budgeted at about 6 wake-ups per active pane per hour
worst case, usually 1 to 3:

```bash
runpane watch --self-test
runpane watch --follow --quiet --kinds agent.ready,agent.blocked,agent.idle,panel.exited,pane.gone --settle 180000 --blocked-settle 30000 --min-interval 600000 --idle-backoff
```

When someone is waiting on the result, use the user-present profile instead:
`--settle 60000 --blocked-settle 15000 --min-interval 120000` with no
`--idle-backoff`, so `READY` arrives within about 3 minutes rather than 13.

A Session orchestrator watches its whole Session with one command instead of
one `--pane` per Pane. The daemon re-reads the Session's Panes on every read,
so `sessions associate` and `sessions detach` need no re-arm, and `JOINED` and
`LEFT` (`pane.associated`, `pane.detached`) report the change. For Session
members with an open PR, the daemon also polls GitHub about every 3 minutes
and reports `PR <pane-name> pane <pane-id> #<number> CONFLICTED`, `CHECKS
PASSED` or `CHECKS FAILED <names>`, and `MERGED` (`pr.conflicted`,
`pr.checks`, `pr.merged`) on transitions only. The cursor defaults to
`session-<uuid>`:

```bash
runpane watch --session <session-id> --follow --quiet --json --kinds agent.ready,agent.blocked,agent.idle,panel.exited,pane.gone,pane.associated,pane.detached,pr.conflicted,pr.checks,pr.merged --settle 180000 --blocked-settle 30000 --min-interval 600000 --idle-backoff
```

After a `RESET`, JSON baseline entries carry `replay: true`. They restate
current state, so a replayed `agent.ready` is never `READY`.

- `--kinds` drops `agent.busy`; `BUSY` carries no action.
- `--settle <ms>` emits `READY` only after the panel stays idle that long. A
  `BUSY` inside the window cancels it silently, which removes the idle/working
  flips a pane makes while it waits on subagents.
- `--blocked-settle <ms>` does the same for `BLOCKED`, so a prompt answered in
  the pane within seconds wakes nobody.
- `--min-interval <ms>` holds non-urgent lines and flushes them together at
  most once per interval. `BLOCKED` bypasses it.
- `--idle-backoff` fires `IDLE` at `--idle-after`, then 30m, 1h, 3h, then
  daily, and resets on any activity.

These flags require `--follow`. Pane Chat arms them automatically through its
pane-orchestrator skill, so you only need them for your own scripts. Pass
`--quiet` to any monitor that wakes an agent: it drops `WATCH OK`, `HEARTBEAT`,
and `WATCH RECONNECTED` (`_ok`, `_heartbeat`, `_reconnected` in JSON), while
`WATCH ERROR`, `RESET`, and `DROPPED` always print. Judge a dead watch by a
non-zero exit or a `WATCH ERROR` line, not by silence. `runpane agent-context
--command watch --json` lists every flag with its default.

Workers can hand back a structured report with `runpane report --state
ready|blocked|failed|done [--pr <n>] [--head <sha>] [--summary-file <path>]
[--question <text>]`. Watchers receive it as `agent.report`
(`REPORT <pane> pane <pane-id> panel <panel-id> ready pr#747 fc5dce9`) only
when `--kinds` lists it, and it skips the `--min-interval` batch.
`runpane panels last-message --panel <panel-id>` reads an agent's last reply
from its transcript.

## Attribution

npm package downloads use `source=npm` when requesting release artifacts from
`runpane.com/api/download`. If that route is unavailable, the CLI falls back to
matching GitHub release assets and prints a warning.

The wrapper also sends best-effort lifecycle telemetry with a persisted
anonymous `install_id`. Count distinct wrapper users with
`count(DISTINCT properties.install_id)` on `runpane_wrapper_*` events. Set
`RUNPANE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` to disable wrapper telemetry.

## Maintenance Notes

Keep the npm and PyPI clients in sync with each Pane release. When changing
shared installer behavior:

- If release asset names or platforms change, update both npm and PyPI wrapper
  artifact matching.
- If `runpane` CLI behavior changes, update both clients and the shared smoke
  tests.
- If the website `/api/download` contract changes, verify npm and PyPI fallback
  behavior.
- If daemon setup flags change, update docs, README files, and wrapper tests
  together.
- Keep the CI wrapper matrix green: Linux, macOS, Windows, Node 20/22, and
  Python 3.8/3.13 (runs on PRs that touch the wrappers or contract).

## Publishing

This package should be published through npm Trusted Publishing from GitHub
Actions. Token-based `NPM_TOKEN` publishing is a fallback for first package
reservation or manual publication only.
